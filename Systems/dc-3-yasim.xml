  FDM by Gary Neely "Buckaroo"

  Speeds (KIAS):
    Vs0    64 (some sources down to 58)
    V1/V2  84
    Va     120
    Vno    158

    Vf     99 (half flaps)
    Vf     97 (full flaps)
    Vlo    126

  Pilot reports suggest stalls are a somewhat hard to get into without a lot nose up trim, but could be memorable once they occur.
  The nose pitches down and there is a significant to severe wing drop. Clean stalls aren't so bad, but full-flap, power-on stalls
  are nasty if one muscled into them.

  The Dakota should be landed on the main wheels, tail-low if desired, but not three-pointed.

  Service ceiling: 24,800', 12,500' on one engine

  G limits:
    flaps up    +2.83/-0.83G
    flaps down  +1.58/-0.44G

  Max crosswind: 13 kts
  Max tailwind when landing: 9 kts

  Minimum idle RPM: ~550
  Max RPM in Auto Lean: 2050
  Max TO power: 1200 HP, 48" MP, 2700 RPM for 1 minute, 180 GPH
  Normal rated (METO): 1050 HP, 41-42" MP, 2550 RPM, 157.5 GPH
  Initial climb: 800 HP, 36" MP, 2350 RPM, 120 GPH
  Normal climb: 700 HP, 31" MP, 2050 RPM, 105 GPH
  Cruise: 625 HP, 31-33" MP, 2050 RPM (to 10,000'), 94 GPH
  Fuel consumption in GPH are estimates.

  Control surface max deflections (degrees):
    flaps    45

<!-- Buckaroo notes:
  Approach/cruise speeds are tweaked for flying results. Let's start approach AoA at half critical AoA and work from there.
  Throttle and mixture are guesses. The single-speed supercharger (boost) should always be considered "on" (1.0). I leave prop
  pitch at full fine (max RPM) for both approach and cruise as this gives more predictable solver results. In flight you'd want
  to increase prop pitch for better economy, engine life, and reduced prop noise. I'll set mixture to about half at cruise;
  mixture is another rather kludged YASim setting.

  Tested for an economoical cruise around 155 KIAS at 4000' (167 KTAS), using 32" MP and 2050 RPM. Using METO power, tops out
  around 176 KIAS (190 KTAS) at 4000'. Seems about right. Stalls somewhere around 55-60 kts. These numbers are slightly
  optimistic, but this is a lightly loaded FDM with no provisions for cargo yet.

  Power settings may be somewhat low on approach to fields near sea level, but these are geared, supercharged engines and have
  a lot of power at low altitudes, the plane is not yet configured for cargo (extra weight) and I haven't done much tweaking of
  engine settings. Note that YASim doesn't do a good job of reporting low-power MP values so low-power MP will read low without
  developer correction.

  <!-- Drag bodies -->
  <!--  Buckaroo notes:
    These drag bodies could be more accurately modeled using a leading cone, a cylindrical midsection, and a trailing cone,
    however I've found that a single element for each major body gives better results in the solver, making it easier to bring
    the Lift and Drag results closer together.

  <!-- Wing -->
  <!-- Buckaroo notes:
    Airfoils are NACA 2215 (root chord) and segment joint chord, and NACA 2206 (tip chord).

    Spar locations (% of root chord):
      Front   17.65%, 0.782/4.431
      Center  38.80%, 1.720/4.431
      Rear    60.00%, 2.659/4.431

    Incidence is 2 degrees.

    Center section dihedral is 0 degrees, outboard 5 degrees from point where outboard segment meets inboard.

    Twist is a guess. The real wing uses an aerodynamic twist (different airfoils at the root chord and wing tips), so
    it's difficult to know.

    I could not locate complete airfoil data for either airfoil, but I have partial data for cL at alphas up to 12 degrees.
    I extrapolated to estimate an average YASim camber of 0.12. Critical AoA is guesswork until I have more complete data, but
    is likely in the 14-16 range; I'll start with 14 and proceed from there. Width and peak are set to give stall behavior
    roughly similar to that described by real DC-3 pilots (see flying notes).

    MAC: 138.1" (3.508m), LE of MAC aft of inboard wing LE: 31.9" (0.810m)
    CG range:
      max forward  11% MAC, 47.1" aft of inboard wing LE
                   23% MAC, 0.807m aft of LE, x=3.384 (recommended CG)
      max aft      28% MAC, 70.6" aft of inboard wing LE

    YASim calculates lift at approximately one-third chord from the wing leading edge. To bring lift closer to the recommended
    CG range, I move the FDM wing forward 0.187 from the physical position of x=2.785 to 2.972. This places theoretical lift
    at 28% MAC.

    Lift and drag values: A manual lists DC-3 flaps as providing a maximum of 35% cL increase and 250-300% parasitic drag
    (value depends on reference). (Split flaps have a lot of drag.) These numbers may not translate directly to YASim, but
    we'll see. The flaps effect on pitch is minimal due to the large drag element.

    Flaps extend under the fuselage, but the effects are likely too marginal to affect the sim much. If desired, an easy way
    to simulate this would be to slightly increase the lift/drag attributes of the inboard flap segment. Flaps apppear have
    no detents, but 4 postions are marked: 0, 1/4, 1/2, full. A relief valve prevents extension of flaps above 97 KIAS.

    Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasps, series unspecified

    Propellers: Hamilton Standard Hydromatic, hub 23E50, blade 6359A or 6477A0, wt/mass: 446 lbs, 202 kg, diameter 11' 6 3/8"
    or 11' 3 3/8" (avg 1.740m radius)

    moment: plain stick method (mR^2)/3 = 202 * 1.74^2 /3 = 203
    governing engine RPM range: 1200-2700 (675-1519 after gear reduction)
    avoid continuous operation at 1300-1700 and 1900-2050

    Thrust incidence is 0 degrees from the station line (-2 from the wing chord line).

    Prop RPMs are based on the gearing ratio, which I believe is correct for YASim. Cruise RPM, alt, and power are taken from
    a POH, cruise speed is really meant for fixed-pitch props; for governed props I simply set it to some typical aircraft
    cruise speed.

    Wastegate is 48" MP for most engines in this series. Turbo-multiplier is set to give 48" MP up to 4000', give or take.
    Make sure a boost (blower) property is defined and initialized to 1. The blower is always engaged. Note that with their
    gearing and always-on supercharger, these engines have a lot of power at sea level.

  <!-- Buckaroo notes:
    The DC-3 tail wheel casters. It is not steerable nor is it coupled to the rudders. Taxi control is via differential engine
    power and braking. Make sure that the controls/gear/tailwheel-lock property is defined and has a handy toggle control as a
    keyboard command at least.

    Main gear compression (max strut extension) should be 0.2m. I'm leaving this at 0.15 for current model compatibility.
    Tail gear should be about 0.114m so 0.1 is OK.

    I've seen gear listed as needing "approximately 12 seconds" to deploy. I'll use 12 seconds until a rate can be verified.

  <!-- Buckaroo notes:
    Standard civilian configuration has 2 main tanks of 210 gallons and 2 aux tanks of 201 gallons each. Each tank holds 5 gallons
    of unusable fuel (20 total). The main tanks are mounted between the front and center spars in the inboard wing segment. The aux
    tanks are mounted directly behind the main tanks, between the center and rear spars. I've calculated locations that place the
    tanks centered between the spars.

    Flight procedure is for each engine to draw from its respective main tank for takeoff and landing. Once cruising altitude is
    reached and each main tank is less than 160 gallons, fuel is then drawn from the auxiliary tanks before switching back to main
    tanks. Minimum fuel for takeoff is 130 gallons distributed between the left and right main tanks.

    Normal fuel pressure is 14-16 psi. Normal boost pump pressure is 14-16 psi. Fuel pressure warning light illuminates when
    pressure is less than 10 psi. Boost pumps are operated when: starting engines, fuel pressure is fluctuating, primary 
    engine pump failure, takeoff and landing, and switching tanks in flight. Otherwise boost pumps are off.
